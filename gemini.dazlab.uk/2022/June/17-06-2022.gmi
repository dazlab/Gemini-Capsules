# Retro Goodies Galore!
### 17th June, 2022

I've recently acquired a couple of Atari 800XL machines, courtesy of eBay. One of these particularly is an outstanding example, coming with a 1050 disc unit and 1010 cassette deck, as well as original manuals in near mint condition. I'd never owned one of these machines back in the day, but I do have fond memories of owning an Atari 2600 (the black one with the metal strip with rainbow markings) that was comming in the European market.
