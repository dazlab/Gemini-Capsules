# Learning C# for Work

### Let's Get "The Basics" Out of the Way

C# has all the usual primitives you'd find in other programming languages: integers, strings, boolean etc. All primitives are value types, and - since it's a managed language - all data structures, objects etc. are reference types. No need to define pointers or worry (too much) about disposing of objects when you're finished with them.

It's a strongly-types language, so you need variable declerations prior to use. Also, if you declare one but never assign it a value the compiler won't allow it. 

```
    internal readonly string { get; private set; }
```

The get and set specify whether the property can be read/written to. Above it's read only, but can be set within the class.

Loops and conditionals are fairly standard, C-syntax stuff. Ive used foreach loops in PHP, and they're identical in C#.

```
foreach(thing as things)
{
    // Do stuff here
};
```
