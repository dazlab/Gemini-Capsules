# The End of the GPU Duopoly
### Rivals eye the lucrative GPU market.

For years, there has effectively been a GPU duopoly; nVidia and AMD control roughly 80 and 20 percent of the market respectively. However, the growth of cloud services, AI, and other intensive HPC applications has fuelled a resurgence in GPU development. The most obvious new contender is Intel, which started developing its discrete graphics card business in 2017.

Early next year, we will see the first fruits: the Arc Alchemist (the DG2 as was). There will be four variants, the beefiest being the DG-512EU - sporting 512 EUs, this is aimed squarely at GeForce RTX and Radeon RX territory. Intel has hinted at a price comparable with a GTX RTX 3080.

Meanwhile, in China, Xindong has previewed its Fenghua No.1 graphics card, and the spec sheet reads well: GDDR6X memory, support for the latest APIs, including Vulkan. The company is aiming the GPU at everything from data centers to desktops. Another Chinese company, Zhaoxin, has demonstrated a prototype discrete card.

nVidia and AMD finally have competition, and it can't come soon enough. We need more cards now and anything that might help push down prices is good news.
