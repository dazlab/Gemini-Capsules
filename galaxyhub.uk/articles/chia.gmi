# Chia Coin Miners Reselling Used SSDs & HDDs as New
### The Chia exodus begins.

Chia Coin is an alternative cryptocurrency coin designed to be a greener solution to the whole cryptocurrency craze, and it started off incredibly strong, leading to crushing HDD shortages. However, the currency has now tumbled to 15 percent of its initial peak over the last three months, so miners are reportedly fleeing to other platforms. According to a report from VNExpress, some miners are now dumping drives and reselling " renewed " SSDs as brand new.

Miners initially purchased massive amounts of storage for Chia plotting, triggering shortages of SSDs and HDDs. Since then, the cryptocurrency has tumbled in value. Naturally, some miners will try to exit the business and move onto something else, but they'll need fresh capital. That means selling off the existing hardware they used for Chia mining.

These drives aren't worth much, as Chia plotting can destrroy average SSDs is less than two months. It's probably only a matter of time before these renewed SSDs filter out to other markets like the rest of Asia, Europe, and the US.
